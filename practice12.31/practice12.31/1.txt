Since it was founded in 1918, 
the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) has coordinated the 
development of voluntary consensus standards in the United States and has 
represented the needs and views of U.S. stakeholders in standardization forums
 around the globe. ANSI is the U.S. member body to ISO and, via its U.S. National
 Committee, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). ANSI is also a member 
 of the International Accreditation Forum (IAF).

ANSI does not write standards; rather,
 the Institute accredits standards developers that will establish consensus among
 qualified groups. Its guiding principles " consensus, due process and openness " are followed by the
 220 distinct entities currently accredited to develop and maintain nearly 10 000 American National Standards (ANS). 
 Though all ANS are developed as voluntary documents, U.S. federal, state, or local bodies are increasingly referring to 
 ANS for regulatory or procurement purposes. Many ANS are also national adoptions of globally relevant international standards.

The Institute's membership is comprised of a broad range of businesses and industrial organizations,
 standards setting and conformity assessment bodies, trade associations, labor unions, professional societies,
 consumer groups, academia, and government organizations for the purpose of enhancing global business competitiveness
 and improving the quality of life for the world's citizens.
The interests of more than125 000 companies and 3,5 million professionals
 are represented through ANSI's headquarters in Washington, DC, and its operations office in New York City.
